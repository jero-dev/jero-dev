## What up! Jero here 👋

I'm a Software Engineer with +4 years of experience, integrating and creating tools that improve the workflow and quality in the engineering teams.

### 👨🏻‍💻 What I'm working on?

Mainly I work with **Microsoft technologies**, like **.NET**, **Azure** and **Azure DevOps**, with a little bit of scripting in **bash** and **PowerShell**. Also, I did my dissertation in **Go**, creating an MVP for having a centralized solution for videogame sales in channels from Telegram or servers in Discord. You can check it [**here**](https://github.com/jero-dev/proyecto-tfg)! (It's in spanish, btw).

Right now I'm working on improving my **Go** skills. In the future, I will start learning more about **frontend technologies** and **mobile development**.
